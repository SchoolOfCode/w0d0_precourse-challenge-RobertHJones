I had several ideas for people for whom I have great admiration and so would have liked to make a tribute page - Noam Chomsky, Carl Sagan, Greta Thunberg, John Steinbeck (amongst many others) - 
but I opted for Slava Rostropovich for a few reasons:
* I figured there was less chance that School of Folks would have heard of him, which hopefully made it more of a voyage of discovery
* He embodies everything I would want to be in a person: 
1. **Unbelievable** music talent
2. A passion and incredible gift for *passing on his knowledge* to as many people as possible - no arcane secrets here!
3. Unflinching humanitarian principles and a love for his fellow humans
* That picture in front of the Berlin Wall is just too damn cool

In making this page I didn't have any issues with the html - which was fairly straightforward - but I think I need to work on my eye for CSS presentation as I feel my tribute page was fairly minimalistic. 


However I feel as though I have solidified my knowledge and understanding of CSS which is satisfying, and learned the familiar lesson that Googling issues is useful in order to find solutions.


I've been using Github for a while but pushing to this repository made me realise sometimes I need to slow down and think about what I'm doing rather than autopilot!
